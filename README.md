# my master-s-thesis Java
Program for calculating the parameters of the ion source of a vacuum neutron tube. The data folder contains examples of pulses from the research stand for a trial run of the program (very few). The !output file contains information about each impulse, instabilities. This was necessary in order to find rare bipolar impulses (about 1-2% of them) and to study them separately. General statistics are output to the console. .txt files with graphs are dropped into the retail folder (along the x-axis there are 2 Î¼s for all). Run through Main.java, folder addresses should be found by themselves. If the program looks a bit strange, it's because there was never a specific end goal, it's all improvisation, independent searches for physics and what is called the "research process". I ran around ~ 20 gigs of statistics on it (35 hours of stand operation), it processes quite jauntily.
